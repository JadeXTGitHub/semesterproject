      <h2>CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF SECURITY</h2>
      <h5>The threat landscape is constantly changing, April 25, 2021</h5>
      <img class="blogimglt" src="cloudy.jpg" alt="Glass half full">
      <p>The forecast calls for clouds, and they show no signs of clearing up.  Digital transformation has been the primary catalyst for this explosion.  The public cloud is attractive because underlying parts of the infrastructure and orchestration procedures hosting the application components are fully managed and mostly hidden such as network functions, Internet access, security, storage, servers, and computing virtualization. Everything is easily configurable through a simple user interface or an API. Security is enforced by using private networks isolated from Internet… or is it?
      <p>Cloud security refers to the technologies, policies, controls, and services that protect cloud data, applications, and infrastructure from threats.  Cloud security involves the procedures and technology that secure cloud computing environments against both external and insider cybersecurity threats. Cloud computing, which is the delivery of information technology services over the internet, has become a must for businesses and governments seeking to accelerate innovation and collaboration.
         Cloud security and security management best practices designed to prevent unauthorized access are required to keep data and applications in the cloud secure from current and emerging cybersecurity threats.</p>

        <h2>TAKING A TOLL</h2>
      <h5>My experiance building a Toll Brother's Home, April 20, 2021</h5>
      <img class="blogimgrt" src="house.jpeg" alt="My House" width="200" height="175">
          <p>As an award-winning Fortune 600 company, Toll Brothers provides homebuyers with expert craftsmanship, innovative floor plans, and gorgeous interiors.  Toll Brothers provide homes that reflect their buyers&apos; personal taste and lifestyle 
        what sets them apart from other luxury builders is their innovative home building system and attention to every detail.
       <p>Doesn't this sound amazing?  Is this really true?  My experience doesn't quite fit the description above.  I fell in love with a particular floor plan in a quiet Toll neighborhood.  From there I started working with the sales associate to determine which plat I wanted to build my home on.  
         Everything was so exciting and going so well.  I made several trips to the design center over several months and then what seemed like days later they broke ground.

      <h2>MY PANDEMIC GLASS IS HALF FULL</h2>
      <h5>Positive change in the face of COVID, April 15, 2021</h5>
      <img class="blogimglt" src="glass.jpeg" alt="Glass half full">
          <p>March 2020 changed a lot for almost everyone.It is a bit surreal, what seemed like overnight our lives changed in a major way.  Employers sent employees home, schools sent students home, and life seemed to stop.  Everyone was told to stay home and only go out for essentials.  Here we are a year later, humans weren’t meant to live in isolation like this,
             many people struggled with loneliness and depression.  The pandemic is challenging us in ways we could never have imagined.  These sudden, rapid changes in the way we live, coupled with uncertainty, can feel overwhelming. While we may know that it’s helpful for everyone to stay positive, it’s sometimes easier said than done.</p>  I made a commitment to myself that I wouldn't let the pandemic get me down, instead I would look at the positive side and make positive changes in my life.  Those changes started with taking multiple walks every day.
               I was able to attend meetings, and participate on calls while walking under a canopy of green.  I also spent time on the treadmill and bought a laptop stand to allow me to walk indoors on inclement days.  I also took my laptop to the backyard and soaked in a little sun on the patio while working.  Not only did I improve my physical health but I also improved my mental health as well.  I also started taking advantage of the fact I was at home was able to take short breaks through the day to do chores like laundry, or dishes.  This allowed me to take a much needed mental break and get chores done before my work day was over.
                 Overall the pandemic has had positive impacts on sustainability, less stress and more time from the change in commute, and a money savings from travel and lunch changes.
